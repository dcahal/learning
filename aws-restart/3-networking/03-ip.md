# Internet Protocol (IP)
Establishes rules for relaying and routing data in the internet
### TCP/IP
* Uses IP addresses to identify devices
* Uses port numbers to identify endpoints
* Supports subnetting to subdivide a network
## IP address
* Uniquely identifies a device on a network
* Identifies both a host and a network
* Used for location addressing
### Dynamic IP
* Useful for devices that leave and rejoin (e.g. laptop)
### Static IP
* Useful for servers, printers, other devices have to connect to
### Public IP
* Globally unique
* Assigned to internet-connected device
* Discoverable by anyone who calls it
### Private IP
* Cannot be accessed via internet
* Assigned to computers within a private network
### Gateway address
* Default router address
* Typically second address in the range (10.0.0.1)
### Broadcast address
* Used to send messages to all nodes on the network
* Last address in the range (10.255.255.255)

## IPv4
* Four dotted quads (8-bit)
* 32-bit address
* Identifies both network and device
## IPv6
* Eight hexidecimal (16-bit) numbers
    * `Prefix`: values 1-3
    * `Subnet`: value 4
    * `Interface`: values 5-8
* Handle packets more efficiently
* Increased security and performance
## Port numbers
* Allows device to further identify other devices and applications
* Enables one computer to send or receive multiple types of data at the same time
### Endpoint
* Exact source or destination of data
* `ip:port`
