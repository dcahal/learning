# Intro to Networking
#### Network
* Collection of devices logically connected to communicate and share resources
#### Node
* Any device on network. Server, switch, modem, printer, etc.
#### Host
* Other devices connect to this so they can access data or services
#### Client
* Access data/service which is managed by another device on network
#### Server
* Responds to requests from clients over the network
* Web, Database, File, Mail, Print
#### NIC Network Interface Card
* Network adapter
* Connects computer to a network
* Ever NIC has its own MAC address
## Cabling
### Coaxial
* Copper + insulating metal + braided shield
### Twisted pair (Ethernet)
* Shielded (STP) protects against interference
* Unshielded (UTP)
### Fiber Optic
* Movoes light, not electricity
* Glass fiber core
* Cladding reflects light down fiber
* Buffer for strength
## Switch / Hub
* Connects all nodes of a network together
### Switch
* Transmits data only to receiving device
* Link established via MAC addresses
* Minimal bandwidth needed
### Hub
* One transmitting device is received and passed to all other hub ports
* All nodes recieve sent data, but only intended target listens
## Router
* Connects multiple switches to form a larger network
* A switch for networks
* Filters and routes data flowing through it, as needed
#### Subnet = switched network under router
