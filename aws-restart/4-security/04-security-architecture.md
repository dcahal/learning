# Prevention: Security Architecture
* Collection of tech reinforcing security throughout OSI model
* Proper security architecture uses:
    * Administrative controls
    * Technical controls
    * Physical controls
## Routers
* Use ACL to filter traffic
    * Define allow/deny rules
* Subnets = segmentation
    * Isolate parts of network
    * Different security access levels
* Process info quickly
* No advanced filtering
## Switches
* Segment and control physical access to network
* Group computers to create virtual large area networks (VLAN)
* Support device authentication
* Protect against network flooding
* Layer 3 switches do routing and switching
