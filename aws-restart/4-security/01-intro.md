## Strategy
### Physical security
Control physical access to resources
### Access Management
* Control access to resources
* Confirm identity
### Known exploits
* Patch as soon as practicable
* If not possible, add other safeguards
### Policies and procedures
* Describe how to set up and manage security strategies
* How to handle security events
## Security controls
* Preventative
* Detective
* Corrective
#### Corresponding to phases of security cycle
### For each type
* Physical
* Technical
* Administrative measures
#### Ensure CIA
## Hacking
### Risk factors
* Physical
* Technical
* Social
