# Assignment: Amazon Leadership Principles

## 1. Which leadership principles do you think are similar?
#### Hire and Develop the Best + Insist on the Highest Standards   
    This one is self-explanatory. If you don't have the best talent, you can never maintain the highest standards. People will just feel overworked and over-burdened. It will destroy people's confidence in you as a leader.

#### Think Big + Ownership
    Having a bold and inspirational direction usually requires a long-term outlook. Short sightedness rarely changes the world. Likewise, big thinkers should consider their whole community or organization, rather than just the needs of their immediate group. Everyone uses their arms when they walk even if they only consider their legs.

#### Learn and Be Curious + Dive Deep
   One of the best ways to learn and broaden your horizons is by occasionally checking out what other people are doing. This is especially true in areas of work or life you don't frequently engage with. You get exposed to new ideas, new experience, new ways of doing things.

#### Bias for Action + Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit + Deliver Results
    There can never be results if action isn't taken. In many situations it's important to act on the moment, and while it is important to discuss possible approaches with others, there's no room for second guessing after the ball gets rolling.

#### Customer Obsession + Earn Trust
    Customers will never have any loyalty to you if they don't trust you or the quality of service you provide.

## 2. Which leadership principles do you think are opposites?
#### Ownership + Frugality
    Frugality is a great skill to have when it's vital to work within constraints. But continuously restraining yourself is not conducive to an inspirational long-term vision for future growth.

## 3. Which leadership principles do you consider your strengths?
#### Learn and Be Curious
    One of my  most important guiding beliefs is that constant personal growth, learning, and introspection is vital to a healthy and happy life.

#### Earn Trust
    Where am I ever going to get in life if people don't trust me to stand by my convictions or own up to my mistakes?

#### Frugality
    I've become an expert in this one. This AWS re/Start class is an example of taking an opportunity when it's right in front of me. 

#### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
    If I let other people decide when I tap out, I'd be a goner by now. Even in Per Scholas, it's all on me to push to make the most of it.

## 4. Which leadership principles can you develop?
#### Invent and Simplify
    I need to always be on the lookout for new opportunities to capitalize on the Per Scholas experience, especially with regard to professional development, things that will actually help land me a job.

#### Deliver Results
    I have a lot of good learning resources that sometimes I keep jumping between them and lose focus. I will benefit if I do a better job drilling down on one class at a time so I can land my certifications.
