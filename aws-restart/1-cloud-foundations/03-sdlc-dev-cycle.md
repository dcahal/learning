# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
## Plan
### What is the problem? What resources are needed to solve it?
* Project plan
* Evaluate costs, HR, operational, technical considerations
* Plan for QA
## Analyze
### What do we want from a solution?
* Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
* Customer approval
## Design
### How will we build what we want?
* Design specification document
* Evaluate possible architecture
* Describe functions, GUI, etc.
* Risk, budget, time review
## Develop
### Build it!
* Write code to design specification
* Choose language
## Test
### Did we get what we want?
* Automated testing: code to test the code
* Common types of test:
    * Unit test: test application components at the program level.
    * Integration test: test combinations of multiple components to verify they work together.
    * Security: probe for vulnerabilities, internal or external.
    * Performance: benchmark and check against needs
## Implement
### Deploy to production
## Maintain
### Improve it! Types of maintenance include:
* Corrective: squash bugs
* Adaptive: respond to changes in the app's runtime environment (e.g. broken dependency)
* Perfective: new or revised functionality
* Preventative: avoid future issues (e.g. refactoring, improve portability)
