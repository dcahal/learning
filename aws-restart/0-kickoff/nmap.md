# nmap

This is the nmap scan from OverTheWire's bandit16:   

> First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

```

### The prompt gives important clues as to how to interpet the scan.
* Don't want the `echo` services
* Only some support SSL
* The service we want returns some relevant output in plain text.
