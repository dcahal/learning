### Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
```python
width = 17
height = 12.0
```
**For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).**
**Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.**
```python
width//2
```
8, int
```python
width/2.0
```
8.5, float
```python
height/3
```
4.0, float
```python
1 + 2 * 5
```
11, int
