# Exercise 3: Modify the program that prompts the user for the file name so that it prints a funny message when the user types in the exact file name “na na boo boo”. The program should behave normally for all other files which exist and don’t exist.

fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
if fname == "na na boo boo" :
    print("Looks like we've got a comedian here. Laugh it up, buddy.")
    exit()
try:
    fhand = open(fname)
except:
    print('File cannot be opened:', fname)
    exit()
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)
